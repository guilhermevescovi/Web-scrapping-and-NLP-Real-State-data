The goal of this project is to implement two clustering methods and compare the results of it. For this project there was no data set available and the data used was scraped from a [website](https://www.immobiliare.it/).

In the main repository there is a single jupyter notebook file contaning all our final analysis. Most of the used functions had been imported in the notebook from other python files, that can be found the repository.

Each section of the notebook but the first start with the loading of some files. They are the files produced during computations in the sections above.
